description: Where the spec lives, how to run CLI/tests, and that behavior conforms to spec/codex

# Project context

- **Spec**: `trace-spec/` (SPEC.md, codex/, ROADMAP.md). CLI behavior and semantics must conform to SPEC and codex; build priorities in ROADMAP.md.
- **Milestones**: Task lists and execution in `trace-spec/milestones/`; plans and archive in `trace-spec/plans/` (eng-manager).
- **Layout**: Implementations `src/`, tests `test/`, spec and schemas `trace-spec/`.
- **Run**: CLI `npm run dev -- [args]`; tests `npm test`.

When changing behavior or adding features, read the relevant spec and codex doc first; keep implementations and schemas in sync.

When adding new commands or spec sections, prompt with **"Use conductor"** or **"Check trace-spec/codex first"** so the right agent and context load (e.g. plan-optimizer for design, debugger for failures).
