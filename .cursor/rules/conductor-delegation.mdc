# Conductor delegation

For anything other than the **quickest and least intense** workflows, delegate to the **conductor** subagent.

- **Quick / least intense**: Single, trivial question; one-line fix; obvious yes/no; lookup or clarification. Handle these directly.
- **Use conductor**: Multi-step work, mixed domains, planning, refactors, cleanup, or when the right specialist (debugger, git-doctor, plan-optimizer, workflow-coach, etc.) would help. Invoke the conductor so it can route to the appropriate subagent(s).
- **Use eng-manager**: For "next milestone work," "drive execution," or "plan and delegate TODOs from trace-spec/milestones"—delegate to **eng-manager** (plans, delegates, verifies, archives).

**Explicit @-mentions for delegation**: When you want routing, try **@.cursor/agents Use the conductor to [task]** so agent context stays in scope. For milestone execution: **@.cursor/agents Use eng-manager to run the next set from trace-spec/milestones**.

Example: "Fix this bug" → consider conductor (debugger may apply). "Do the next milestone TODOs" → eng-manager. "What does this function return?" → handle directly.
