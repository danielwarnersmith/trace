# Agent index

When you add a new subagent file under `.cursor/agents/` (e.g. `my-agent.md`), update **`.cursor/agents/README.md`** so the index stays current:

1. Add a row to the table with the agent **name** (from frontmatter `name`) and a **one-line purpose** (from frontmatter `description`, condensed if needed).
2. Keep the table sorted by agent name, or keep conductor first and the rest alphabetical.

This helps both humans and the model choose the right specialist.
